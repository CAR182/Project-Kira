# Project Kira

This project was created as a training module for my graduate engineers. I wanted to make something that was a little more visually
exciting than what we had available at the time and I find "live clones" a great way of learning. The ability to be able to "stand on the
shoulders of giants" understand what these companies had done and attempt to replicate it throws out interesting challenges and the end result
is visually satisfying.

This project was made in 2022~ and I haven't really touched it in a while so it's likely things are out of date and like I said, it was training module
not a professional development piece so take some of the approaches with a pinch of salt but maybe you'll learn something. Enjoy!
